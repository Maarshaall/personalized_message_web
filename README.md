# Daily Love Messages 🌸

A private and personal website created as a gift for my partner.  
It displays daily messages, photos, and videos in a warm, interactive layout.

## 💡 Project Overview

This project was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and reads content from an `.xlsx` spreadsheet. Each row corresponds to a new day's message. The spreadsheet defines:

- A custom text message
- Optional image with caption
- Optional video (either embedded from YouTube or uploaded)

The website reads the spreadsheet using [`SheetJS`](https://sheetjs.com/) and dynamically displays content only for past and current days, not future ones.

## 🔐 Privacy Notice

The full version contains personal content and is private.  
This repository only includes the structure and functionality of the project.

## 🚀 Deployment

The site is deployed on Netlify, ensuring smooth static hosting with automatic deployment from GitHub.

## 📌 Technologies Used

- HTML5 / CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- SheetJS (xlsx parsing)
- Netlify for deployment
